## Risk Analysis

### Risks

| ID | Feature | Risk Description | Likelihood | Impact | Priority | Mitigation Strategy |
|----|---------|------------------|------------|--------|----------|---------------------|
| R-01 | Leaderboard | Incorrect sorting ‚Üí wrong top-3 shown | Medium | High | High | Add unit tests for sorting, snapshot after updates |
| R-02 | Reset Game | State not fully cleared ‚Üí residual score persists | Low | High | Medium | Add integration test for reset; ensure reset function resets all relevant state variables |
| R-03 | Bonus Round | Bonus multiplier applied incorrectly (off-by-one) | Medium | Medium | Medium | Add boundary tests for round counters; add logging around multiplier calculation |
| R-04 | UI Responsiveness | Controls overlap at small widths ‚Üí usability degradation | Medium | Medium | Medium | Add responsive checks in Chrome DevTools; add simple CSS fixes or constraints |
| R-05 | Input Validation | Invalid characters break scoring or crash the app | Low | High | Medium | Sanitize and validate inputs; add negative tests for special characters and scripts |
| R-06 | Persistence | localStorage or corruption prevents leaderboard save | Low | Low | Low | Limit stored entries; implement graceful fallback (in-memory) and user notification |

### Risk Coverage

- Total identified risks: 6
- Risks covered by test cases: 6
- Tested Risks Percent: 100%
- Untested Risks Percent: 0%

## Test Cases

| ID | Feature | Objective | Steps (summary) | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status | Risk Link |

| TC-02 | Reset Game | Verify Reset clears score & progress | Play to score >0 ‚Üí Click Reset | Score=0, puzzle index resets | Score & index reset | Pass | R-02 |
| TC-03 | Bonus Round | Verify every 3rd puzzle applies x2 multiplier | Complete puzzles 1‚Äì3 and note points | Puzzle 3 points = base √ó2 | Multiplier applied correctly | Pass | R-03 |
| TC-04 | Input Validation (Negative) | Ensure invalid inputs don't crash app | Submit "<script>" as answer | App sanitizes/blocks input; no crash | App threw an error | Fail | R-05 |
| TC-05 | Leaderboard (Boundary) | Verify only top 3 scores persist | Submit >3 scores with varying values | Only top-3 are stored | Top-3 retained | Pass | R-01 |

**Progress Tracking Method:** GitHub Issues for defects, Markdown files for risk analysis, test cases and metrics.

**Change Control Notes:** Any scope deviation or blocked tests were recorded as issues and communicated via the project board.

## Lessons Learned

- Most Defect Prone Feature: User interface input (R-05) - No filtering and verification of input.
- Risk Analysis Impact: Prioritizing User-inputs tests found high-impact defects early.
- Team Communication Effectiveness: Daily short syncs helped coordinate testing.
- Improvements for Next Cycle: Add small unit tests for core logic (input validation,sorting, multiplier) and automate a smoke test that runs on each push.

## Overall Summary

Statement:
The team executed the planned test cases against the Word Puzzle Game Plus. Most planned test cases passed (75% pass rate). One high-severity defects was identified and still open and one medium-severity defect remains open. The team recommends prioritizing the open defects before final sign-off and adding small automated checks for sorting and input validation.
